# Skill: Explain Code

## Trigger
User shares code and asks "what does this do", "explain this", or "how does this work".

## Process
1. Identify the language and framework
2. Give a one-line summary first
3. Walk through the code section by section
4. Highlight key patterns, idioms, or techniques used
5. Note any potential issues or gotchas

## Output Format
```
**Summary**: [one line]

**Walkthrough**:
1. [section]: [explanation]
2. [section]: [explanation]

**Key Concepts**: [patterns/techniques used]

**Watch Out**: [gotchas or potential issues]
```

## Guidelines
- Match explanation depth to user's apparent level
- Use analogies for complex concepts
- Don't skip "obvious" parts — they may not be obvious to the user
- Add inline comments to the code if helpful
